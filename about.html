<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Mina, a 20-year-old Computer Engineering student currently in my third year of university. Over the course of my studies, I’ve developed strong programming skills in C, C++ (both introductory and advanced levels), Python, and MySQL. I also have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and C#, which has helped me understand the fundamentals of web development.</p>

<p>In addition to my programming skills, I have experience in data analysis, a field that fascinates me as I enjoy working with large datasets to extract meaningful insights. I’m always eager to learn more and challenge myself, which has shaped me into a quick, self-taught learner.</p>

<p>One of my biggest passions is tech and AI development. I’m particularly interested in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), fields that I believe will shape the future of technology. I’m constantly exploring new opportunities in these areas and hope to contribute to innovations that will have a real-world impact.</p>
